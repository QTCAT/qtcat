Package: qtcat
Title: Quantitative Trait Cluster Association Test
Description: An association mapping method which jointly analyses all SNPs at
    once and at the same time accounts for the correlation between them. This
    makes correction for population structure unnecessary and therefore
    increases power compared to classical methods like the mixed model.
